intellect, cannot make pesce. The sumo is to be said of a king in
captivity, provided he received his sovereignty from the people; for
itis not to be supposed thet they would bestow the power, to be
used by a person who was not free. Hence, in this case, tho sove-
reignty, not indeed as to its whole rights, but as far as exercisc and
guardianship, will bo with the people, or him to whom the people
commits it

2 But as to things which belong to himself, if a king, even in
captivity, mnke any compact, it will be valid, according to the example
of private conventione, of which we have spoken. But it' the king be an
exile, cen he make peace? Yes, if he is under no constreint; other·
wisc, his condition differs little from that of a captive: for the custody
of a captive is often lex. Regulus reiuscd to deliret his opinion in
the Senete, seving thet so long es he was anderen cath to the
enemy, he was not a senator.

IV. In en aristocraticel or democretienl state, the right of muk-
ing treaties will be with the majority, respectively, of the Council, end
of the Assembly of citizens who have a vote, aa we have elsewhere
said. Therefore conventione so mede, bind them also who dissented.
