VI. Quid dicemus de subditorum bellis aduersus reges
aliasque summus potestates? his, etiamsi causam persensu
injustam habeant, jus tamen per vim agendi deesse ostendimus
elibi. Potest interdum et tauta esse eut cousae injustitia, nutrisse
resistendi improbitas, ut puniri graviter possit. Tamen si
quasi cum desertoribus aut rebellibus actum sit, pmua pro-
misso opponi non potest, secundum ea quae modo diximus.

VI. What shall we say oi the ware of subjecta against kings aud
other supreme authorities? That these, eren when they have a causo
in itsolf not nujust, still have not the right of acting by force, we have
shown elsewhere. But sometimes, in such cases, the injustius oi tho
cause, or the wickedness of the resistance, moy be so great, that it msy
be liable to heavy punishm0nt. And yet it a treaty be conducted with
