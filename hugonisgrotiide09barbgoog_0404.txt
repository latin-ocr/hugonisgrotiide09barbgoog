IX. 1 Homines, imperia, agros, bello quaesita concedere

Maharbal Romanis quibusdam, qui ex praelio ad Trasimenum

of equal authority; as the history of Fabius and Marcellus in Livy
declares.

IX. 1 In the same way, it is not thc business ef generals to gire up
men, conquesta, lande, obtained in war. By this ruia, Syria was taken
from Tigranes, though Lucullus had giren it to him. of Sophonisba,
who had been taken prisoner in war, Scipio says that the judgment
and decision cf the Senate and Pecple oi Rome was to determine3 and
that therefore Masinissa, though the general by whom shc was taken,
could not gire ber liberty. That orer other things which are taken
as prins of war, a certain dispcsalis conceded to persons in authority,
we hare scen; not so much from the force of their pewer, aa from tho
eustoms ci each pecplc: en which subject wa bare already spoken
sufficicntly.

2 1t is however in the power ef generals te grant the possession
oi things not yet sequired: because towns sometimes and men cisen
surrender themselves in wer, cn condition of lires being spared‚ cr
liberty, or property ς among which concessione generally, the state cf
things dces not allow the decisicn cf the supreme authority to be
ashed. And by parity of reason, this right is also giren to commandcrs‘
who are not the highest, within the limite oi the matters which are
committed te them to executa. Maharbal had giren te some Romans
whc had escaped from the battle at Trasimenum, Annibal being absent
