XXIX. 1 Quaeri et hoc solet, an pretium conventum et
ante mortem non solutum ab herede debeatur. Expedita
mihi videtur responsio, siin carcere mortuus est, non deberi:
promisso enim inerat conditio, si liberaretur: mortuus autem
non liberatur. Contra, si mortuus cst cum in libertate esset,
deberi. Jam enim lucratus erat id, pro quo promissum erat

retium.

tractus momento pure debeatur pretium, et captivus. tantum
retineatur, non jam ut jure belli captus, sed ut a se oppigno-
ratus: et contra pactum iniri posse, ιιι procedat pretii solutio,
si die prestituto, qni captus sit, liber vivat. Sed hsec ut

could not be the posseaor of it. From which it follows, that property
so conoeeled may be applied to furnish the amount of ransom3 tho
ownership having been retained by the prisoner. ;

XXIX. 1 This is also ι frequent questions whether the ransom
agreed upon, and not paid before death, bc dne from the heir. The
answer appears to me to be obvious, if the prisoner disin captivity,
that it is not dne: for tho promise was, on the condition that the
prisoner should be liberated, end ι dead man ιι not liberated, On
the other hand, if he dies when heis ιι liberty, ιι is due; for he
had already got the thing for which the price was promised.

2 I undoubtedly confess that the agreement may be made otber-
wise, so thet, from tho moment of the contrsot, the price may be abso·
lutely due, and the prisoner may bo retained, not now ιι ι prisoner
οι war, butas a pledge gisen by himself: and on the other hand, that
it may bo coronanted that the psyment of the price shall take place,
if on a certain appointed day, he who is captive, be alive and free.
But such conditions, as being less natural, ιιι not to be presnmod,
except upon manifest evidence.

XXX. This question alsois proponndod: whether ιι ought to
return into captivity, who was set free, on the compost that he should
cause another to be liberated, who, by dying, presented thet being
done. We have elsewhere said that the liberal promise of athird
person ιι fulfllled with sufficient essetness, if nothing be omitted on
