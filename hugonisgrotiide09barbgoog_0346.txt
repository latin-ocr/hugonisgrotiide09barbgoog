Athenienses mansit. Eadem distinctione adversus AEtolos
utebatur T. Quinctius Coptcram, inquiens, arbium illone-mut
lec. Thessalia civitates aroc volontate ia ditionem noctram

XV. Si nihil aliud convenerit, omni pace id actum cen·
seri debet, ut quae bello data sunt damna, eorum nomine actio
nonsit: quod de damnis etiam priuatim acceptis intelligen-
dum est: nam et haec belli effecta sunt In dubio enim ita
censentur contrahere voluisse bellantes, ut neuter injustitiae
damnaretur. Ι

XVI. Non umen et que privatis deberi coeperunt belli namu.
tempore condonata censori debent, nam haec non balli jure
quaesita sunt, sed bello tantum exigi vetita. Itaque sublato

also of losses to private persons; for these are the effecte of war. For
in a doubtful matter, the contracting belligerent parties are to be
supposed to hare intended that neither should be condemned us
unjust.

XVI. But debts which were due to private persons at the time of
the war breaking out, are not ιο be supposed cancelled3 forthere are
ιιοι acquircd by the right of war, but only presented by war from
being exacted. And therefore, when the impediment is removed,
they retain their force. But though the right which existed before
the war, is not lightly to be supposed to be tehen from any one, (for
