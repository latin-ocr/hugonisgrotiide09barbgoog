X. Sed hoeo inspectio, ne nisi ex publica utilitate res
privatorum concedantur, regem spectat et subditos, ut ills de
damno sarciendo civitatem et singulos. Nam externis, qni
oum rege contrahunt, sufficit laetum regis, non tanturn ob
praesumtionem quarn seenrn adfert dignitas personae, rerum
etiam ob gentium jus, quod bona subditorum obligari ex lacto
regis patitur.

XI. 1 Circa interpretandas pacis conventiones observan-
dum est qnod snpra anobis est traditum, quo quidque plns
habet lusoris, eo laxius accipiendum quo longius abit, eo
restrictius. Si jus naturae merum spectamus,1naxin1usiavor
iu eo esse ridetur nt suurn quisque consequntur, qood Greci
dieunt ἕκαστον ἔχειν τοι ἑαυτοῦ, οι proinde ridetur ambigue
pop'torum interpretatio eo ducenda, utqui juste arms habuit
id consequatur ob quse arms sumsit, et damus sumtusque
recuperet: non item ut pcenae nomine quicquam lucretur, id

king and his subjectos the other consideration, respecting compensa·
ation for loss, regards the state and individuale. For ss regards suan·
gers who contrnct with tho king, the aet of the king is ιοιιιοιοιιιι ιιοι
only on account of the presumption of due authority which the dignity
οι the person implies; but also from the haw of N ations, which allows
the goods oi subjecto ιο be bound by the ιιοι οι the king.

xl, 1 With regard to the interpretation of conventione oi peace,
wo must observo what has beon delivered above that 3 in proportion
as any condition is more iaronrahle, it is ιο he ιοιιοιι more looselpr
ln proportion ns it is the contrary, more restrictedly. If we regard
mere Natural Law, the most farourable condition seems ιο be, that
each shall obtain his own: and therefore the interpretation of doubt·
ful expressions is ιο be drawn ιο that sense3 that he who has taken
up arnis justly, shall obtain that for which ho went ιο war, and reoorer
his losses and expensas hut not that he shall obtain anything under
tho ples οι penalt53 for that is more odious.
