superveniente abierant, victores se rati et id suis renuntiaturi.

Neque Corinthios fugaverant Corcyraei, sed Corinthii, cum pu ocyus
feliciter pugnassent, Atheniensium classem validam conspicati‚⁵ m

nullo cum Atheniensibus virium periculo facto, cessim ierant
Philippus vero Macedo Attali quidem navem a su1s desertam

Polybius notat, magis pro victore ee gerebat, quam victorem upum xlvp1

that in all the three, the parties separated without a real victory. 'l’he
Argives, in Herodotus, were not put to ssight by Othryades, but went
away on night coming on, thinking themselves victorious, and carried
that newa to their friends. Nor did the Cercyreaus in Thucydides
put tc ssight the Corinthians3 but the Corinthiam, when they had car·
ried on tha combat successfully, seeing the fleet of the Atheniens
approach in force, retreated without trying their strength with it. In
Polybius, Philip of Macedon took indeed the ahip of Attalus when it
had been deserted by its crevv, bnt was very far from having put to
ilight his fleet; and therefore, aa Polybius says, he rather bore himself
aa victor, than thought himself victofions.

3 These proceedings, of collecting the spoils, granting the bodies
of the dead for sepulture, provoking the adversary to renew the battle,
which, in the places just quoted, and in Livy, you sometimes find put
forwerds aa signs of victory, of themselves prove nothing; exceptae fur
as they go along with other indicatione to prove tho ssight of the
enemy. Certainly he who has left the field may, in a case of doubt, be
supposed to have run away. But when there is no clear proof of
victory, the matter remsins in the condition in which it was before
