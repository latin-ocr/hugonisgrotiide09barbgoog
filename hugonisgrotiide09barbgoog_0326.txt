Balbo explicat, religione obligabatur.

2 Est ad hane rem pertinens disputatio per se obscurior
apud Livium libro tertio, ubi ex sententia multorum juris in·
terpretum ait tribunos esse sacrosanctos, non etiam aediles,
jndices, decemviros, quorum tamensi cui noceretur id non

id ratum erat, manente tamen lege nemini contra agere jus
erat: at tribunos religio publica populi Romani tuebatur: nam
jusjurandum intercesserat, quod ab his ipsis qui juraverant

and by such, the Roman people itself, as Cicero for Balbus explains,
was in conscience bound.

2 There is a sumerhat obscure dissertation on this subject, in the
third Book of Livy, in which he says thot, according to the opinion of
many jur-ists, the tribunes were socrosanct, but not the ediles, judges,
decemrirs ς though if herm was done to any of them it was unlawful.
The cause of the difference is, that the ediles and others were defended
hy the law only, and while the law insted, no one might act against
it; but the tribunes were defended by the public religione engage-
