sunt efficere, ιιι in principalium interpretatione a regula rece·
datur: ejus autem naturam etipsa sequi debent.

LVllI. Obiter hcc addendum est, obsides interdum non
accessionem esse obligationis, sed revera partem principalem:
ut cum quis ex contractu factum promittit non suum, et quia,
eonon praestito, tenetur ad id quod interest, ejus vice obsides
obliganturt quam suism videri sententiam Caudina sponsionis
diximum alibi. Non durs tantum, sed et iniqua est sententiaglgstst
existimantium, obsides etiam sine consensu suo alterum ex ,Age-(mit
iacto alterius posse obligari. ’

LIX. Pignora quaedam communia habent cum obsidibus,
quaedam propria. Commune, quod et ex alio jam debito re-
tinentur, nisi obstet data fides: proprium, quod quae de iis
est pactio, non tam stricte sumitur, quam illa de obsidibus:
nequeenim aequale est odium. Res enim natae sunt, ut te·
neautur, ιιοιι οι homines.

LX. Illud alibi quoque diximus, nullum tempus id effi-nb-tsm
cere posse, ne luitio sit pignoris, si id praestetur, pro quo pig-
nus suppositum est. Nam qui actus causam veterem et notam
habet, uon creditur ex nova procedere. ldeo patientia debi-

LVIII. This however may be added in passing: that sometimes
the hostages sre not sn accessory part oi the obligation‚ but really a
principal part ι as vvhen any one, bp eontract, promises something to
be done by another3 and, that not being performed is held to the
amount of interest involved in the agreement ; theu his hostsges are
bound in his plaee; which vves the doctrine held in the Caudino con-
vention, as ve have elsewhere stated. The opinion of those vvho hold
that hostsges are bound for one another’s acts, even vvithout their own
consentis hard and unjust.

LIX. Pledges have some points in common vvith hostages, some,
peculias. It is common to the tvvc, that being given for one thing,
they may be retained for another, except a stipulaticn to the contrary
have been made. And it is peculiar to Plodges, that the covensut
vhich is made concerning them, is not to be talen so strictly as that
conoerning hostageec for things are made, ιο be held as propert„
menore not.

LX. We heve also said elsewhere, that no period oi time cau·
supersede the obligation of restoring the pledge, if that be donc to
secure which the pledge vves doposited. For an act which hes an old
and known caussis not ιο be believed to come from a new one.
Theresore the forbearance of the debtor [vho deposited the pledge]
