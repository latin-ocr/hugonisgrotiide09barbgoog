temporariis henc potestatem: sed neque lex hoc semper facit3

parcit enim civibus: neque semper fecere potest: nam leges
humanm, ιιι alibi diximus, sim obligandi tum demum habent, prgis-sut&
si lstae sint sd humanum modum, non si onus injungant, qoodt'12’e'2?
aratione et nstrrrs plane abhorreat. Et ideo leges et prae·
cepta specialia, ques tale quid aperte prse se ferunt, pro legi·

bus haberi non debent; generales autem leges interpretatione
benigna ita accipiendae sunt, ut ossus summes necessitatis ex-
cludant.

4 Quod si actas, qui lege aut precepto interdictus erat, et
valere vetitus, interdici aequo jure potuit, jam irritus erit ectus
privati, sed puniri temen idem poterit, ideo quod promisit id,
quod soi juris non crat, maxime si juratus id fecerit.

Vl. Promissio ceptiri de redeundo in carcerem meritc
toleretur: nequeenim deteriorem reddit csptiri conditionem.
Non ergo, ut quidam existimant, gloriose tentam fecit M. At·
tilius Regulus, sed et qnod debebat: Regulus, inquit Cicero, mmm.

tender cf the interests of citizens. For human lawe, ss wc hare elec·
where said, have then, and then only, o binding force, if they are made
in a humane manner, not ifthey impose burthens which sre repug-
nant to reason sud nature. And therefore special lsws end precepts
which haro, upon the fece of them, snything of this kind, sre not to be
held ss lawe: and general lawe sre ιο be interpreted indulgently, so
ss to exclude ceses of extreme necessity.

4 If an act, which was interdicted by s law or precept, and de· <
prired of its validity by prohibition, could be interdicted with reason-
able right, the set of the prirete person will be roid3 but ct the same
time he is lisble to punishment for haring promised what was not in
his power, and especially if hc did it under ooth.

vl. The promise cf a prisoner to return into captivity is rightly
allowed: for it dces not render the condition of the prisoner worse
than it was. And therefore Regulus, in doing whst he did, acted not
gloriously only, as some think, but cleo ss he ought. Regulus, says
Cicero, ouyht ιιοι ιο disturt tte conditione ond menone bobum to tls ,
