194 ‚ MONITA DE HIS, QUAE ’ [Lm. 111.

uidebantur, runieimuc. Videbantur, ait, quia injustum id
ιιι '²¹² ω· bellum iuerat, nt jam ante agnoverant Samnites

2 Non dissimile est, quod ex contractu sine dolo inito,

,Ψ ,φ cui inest inaequalium· yure gentium nascitur facultas quaedam
cogendi eum qui contraxit ad implenda pacta· nec eo tamen
minin, qm plus mque stipulatus est rem ad equalitatem ιοιιιι-
oere ex probi ac pir hominis officio tenetur.

VI. 1 Sed et, qui ιιιιιιιιιιιιι ipse non dedit, aut sine
omni culpa dedit, sed rem bello injusto captam ab ulio penes
sc hebet, tenetur eam reddere, qnia cur alter ca carere debeat
nulla caum subest naturaliter justa, non consensus ipsius, non
malum meritum, non compensatio. Non ahena ab hec re his·
toria est apud Valerium Maximum ε populns, inquit, Βοιιιοιιιιι
cum P. Claudius Comminus ductu atqrae αιιιρίοἰιι auia cap-
ιοι melincta uendidisset, etsi cerarium pensata, fines agria

ι caputius redemit, ιι pradia re- nis reddi. Josephua xiv. Anticum Hia-
ιιίιιιι] Antonius Tyrios coegit reddere, turin, (Cap. 12. ἓ 6, dicia. Medeon.)

gua Judaorum tenebant. flumineasb Macrinus Parthia reddidit captives at
cis venditos lussit liberari, bona domi· pradum, quod moso non fuisset, cnr

nites, in Livy, gire np what they had talene which, they say, ιιιιιιι·
cura ty ιιι right cy* war.- samad, because the rer was unjust, as the
Samnites had consented.

2 Itis a case of the ιιιιιι kind, that an unoqud contract, made

without deceit, giren, hythe Lar oi Nations, a right oi compelllng ιιιο
iuliilment ef the compacts3 and yet he who has the advantage, isbonnd
by the duty ei an honest and picus man, ιο reduce itte equality.

VI. 1 But also, he who has ιιοι caused any damage, er has
caused it without any fault, but who hcs' ιιι his possession a thing
talen ιιι war hom another, re bound to restore it, because there is no
cause, naturally J'ust, why the other should be deprived οι· ιι; not hia
consent; not his ill desert ι not compensation. There is a story to
thie effect in Valerius Maximus: When P. Οιιιιιίιιι lud taken cod
sold ιιι pepo of Camerina, ulttonpt ιιι mocsey uod ιιι cooptari wm
very odmmupeoau, ιιι Rumon pecple ιοιιιιι them οιιι uod mamea ιιιιιι,
tommo ιιι justice os ιιι proceediop did not reem eicere ond poue tiemo
dualitate ia ιιι Avonam, and reuoond their property. So, by a decrec oi
tha³Romans, the Phocenses had their liberty and land restored. So
the Ligariana rho had been sold by M. Popilius, were redecmed and
restored to liberty, and their property giren back. So with regard
to the Abderites, the senate decreed the nme thing, adding the reason
that the war had been uny'ust.

2 But he who holds auch property, if he hare spent anything
open it, may dedunt aa much as it was ιιοιιιι ιο the owner to reocrer
