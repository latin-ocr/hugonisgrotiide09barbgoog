what was done, and allowed it to ιι done; and in this case, if no other
reason [besides consent] can be probably assigned, we have elsewhere
stated what course the matter must take. The superior authority are
obliged by the thing itself ιο this extent ς that they are not ιο ιο
made better off by the loss of other persons; that ia, that they are
either to fulhl tho contract by which they wis-h to obtain an advantage,
οι ιιι ιο gire up the advantag03 a case of equity which we hare
elsewhere discnssed. And ιο far, and no further, acts which are
performed so aa ιο bring utility to us, are ιο ιι said to ιο aalid. On
the other hand, they cannot be exeused from the charge of injustioe,
who, while they condemn the compact, retain that which without the
compaet they would not have: as when the Roman Sonate neither
could approwe ιιι ιιι of On. Domitius, nor would rescind it: of which
kind of occurrence we have many in history.

IV. l We must also repeat what we heresuid before, that he
who placed a person in a command, is bound, even though the person
ιο placed acts against secret orders3 at least, within ιιι limita of his
public function. This rulo of equity was rightly followed by tho
Roman Praetor, in the action against ιιι Agont3 for it is not ewerything
done by the Agent which obliges tho Principal, but such things only as
are contracted in the matter for which his agency was employed 3 but
he concerning whom public notice was gisem that contracte with him
would not be held good by the Principel, does not stand in the place
